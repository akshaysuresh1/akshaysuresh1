I leverage data and artificial intelligence (AI) tools for positive human and climate impact. In the past, I engineered software pipelines to automate searches of terabytes of astronomy data for exotic events, including plausible signs of intelligent life beyond the Earth.

**Major project highlights:**
- Led the test-driven development of a [segmentation model to detect Amazon rainforest cover in satellite imagery](https://akshaysuresh1.com/projects/2025_06_15_AmazonForestSegmentation). eliminating up to 15 hourss of tedious manual data labeling per week.
- Conducted a [rooftop solar feasibility study](https://akshaysuresh1.com/projects/2024_05_14_LiDARSolarPotential) using LiDAR, revealing that 53% of homeowners in DeLand, Florida, can save over $1,000 annually by transitioning to solar-powered households.
- Developed a [scalable tool for near real-time forecast of earthquakes induced from underground carbon storage](https://akshaysuresh1.com/projects/2022_08_31_FDL_CO2), thereby enabling proactive measures to minimize the seismic hazard.

Outside of work, I enjoy following cricket, playing board games, and exploring natural wonders. Visit my [personal website](https://akshaysuresh1.com) to learn more about my experiences in and beyond the workplace.
