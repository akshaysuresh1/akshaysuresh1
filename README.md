I am Akshay Suresh. Professionaly, I love developing artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to tackle challenging real-world problems and generate sustainable benefit for humanity.

Building on my educational training in physics and data science, I am excited to make impactful contributions in the following domains.
- AI for climate change
- AI for healthcare
- Environment perception algorithms for autonomous vehicles
- Pioneering safe artificial general intelligence

Outside of work, I enjoy following cricket, playing board games, and exploring natural wonders. Visit my [personal website](https://akshaysuresh1.com) to learn more about my experiences in and beyond the workplace.
